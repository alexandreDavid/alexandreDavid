### Hi curious people,

I'm Alexandre and I'm a front-end developer and it's probably the coolest job on earth! At least for me.

When you imagine all that you can do as front-end developer you realise that you don't really have any limits. Except maybe your monitor frame but it's 2021 and I'm sure in 5 year we will say but how they could work on a laptop back then, so old...

Anyway, I'm currently helping a bunch of projects in my current main principal framework AKA **Vue.js** and trust me it's pretty cool. Of course, if I forget to change my homepage and you read that in 2030 you will probably tell the same jokes I make from JQuery !!! Don't check, you weren't born yet...

My advice to you guys, interested in Vue.js (in 2021), DO IT, JUST DO IT ! So easy to learn and probably the top 1 front-end framework in the next months (At least in my heart).

If you want to have my bio, and if it's 2025 you might check on wikipedia, LOL this guy is so arrogant. If we are in 2021, I'm freelance, multilingual :
 - **fr-FR**: the land where everything started back in 1989, and probably football World cup winners and European Champions at this time,
 - **en-GB**: I have a tear when I remember my awesome houseshare in the wonderful city of Oxford,
 - **pt-BR**: O país mais incrível, graças a Deus podemos ter carnaval ano que vem,
 - and **es-ES**: I must admit that I was better few years ago.

I'm passionate, organised, communication skills on the top, incredibly funny so I'm a perfect teammate!

Please contact me if you have any needs, I can help you!

Abraço, Alex
