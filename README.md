### Hi curious people,

I'm Alexandre and I'm a front-end developer and it's probably the coolest job on earth! At least for me :computer:.

When you imagine all that you can do as front-end developer you realise that you don't really have any limits. Except maybe your monitor frame but it's 2022 and I'm sure in 5 year we will say but how they could work on a laptop back then.

Anyway, I'm currently helping a bunch of projects in my current main principal framework AKA **Vue.js** and trust me it's pretty cool.

I'm passionate, organised, communication skills on the top, incredibly funny so I'm a perfect teammate!

Please contact me if you have any needs, I can help you! :fist_right::fist_left:

Have a wonderful day, Alex
